## Project Description

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform
- Keyframes

## Plan on improving the project

There are some issues with the layout of the section header that result in a visual discrepancy compared to the design brief. Modifying the max or min-height properties, or setting a fixed height, may help resolve this problem.

Another potential improvement would be to enhance the visual appearance of the links by adding text-shadow to their hover state. This addition can contribute to an overall improved aesthetic.
